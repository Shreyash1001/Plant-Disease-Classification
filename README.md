PROJECT OUTLINE

<h1>PROJECT NAME: Plant Disease Classification</h1>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
The project aims to develop a plant disease classification system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify infected plant leaves based on images. The project will leverage image processing techniques, deep learning algorithms, and transfer learning to achieve accurate predictions.

<h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVE</h2>
The objective of this project is to develop a plant disease classification system that can accurately identify and classify different types of diseases affecting plants. The system will utilize machine learning techniques to analyze images of plant leaves and determine the presence of diseases such as fungal infections, viral infections, nutrient deficiencies, and other common plant ailments. By accurately identifying plant diseases, the project aims to assist farmers, gardeners, and agricultural experts in early detection and prompt treatment of plant diseases, ultimately leading to improved crop yield and reduced economic losses in the agricultural sector.
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES	</h2>
<ul>
<li>Transfer Learning: Transfer learning will be employed to leverage pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. By using these models as a starting point, the project can benefit from their learned features and significantly reduce training time.
<li>Deep Learning: TensorFlow and Keras will be utilized to build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant disease classification. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in the data.
<li>Computer Vision: OpenCV will be used for image acquisition, enhancement, restoration, color image processing, and segmentation. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries and functions for working with images and extracting relevant features.
</ul>
<h2>DATASETS</h2>
The dataset used for this project is the "New Plant Diseases Dataset" available on Kaggle. It contains a large collection of images of plant leaves classified into various categories such as healthy, infected with different diseases, and seemingly infected. The dataset provides a diverse range of plant diseases, allowing for robust training and evaluation of the classification model.
